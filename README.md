# Logic exercise repository

This repository contains Python programs for various exercises to practice different concepts.

## How to Execute a Python Code

To execute a Python code from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned or extracted the repository.

4. To run a specific Python script, use the following command:

   ```
   python filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run. For example, to run the "ex01.py" script, use:

   ```
   python ex01.py
   ```

   Note: If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` to specify the Python 3 interpreter.

5. The program will run, and you will see the output of the script displayed in the terminal or command prompt.




## Exercise 1: Simple Calculator
Create a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and returns the result of the operation.

## Exercise 2: Prime Numbers
Write a function that checks whether a number is prime or not. Then create a program that prints the first 10 prime numbers.

## Exercise 3: Factorial
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. Next, create a program that allows the user to enter a number and displays the corresponding factorial.

## Exercise 4: Palindrome
Create a function that checks whether a word is a palindrome (that is, whether it reads the same backward and forwards). The program must ask the user for a word and inform whether or not it is a palindrome.

## Exercise 5: Table
Create a program that receives a number from the user and displays the table of that number, from 1 to 10.

## Exercise 6: Vowel Counter
Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a string. The program should ask the user for a sentence and display how many vowels it has.

## Exercise 7: Grade Average
Create a program that takes a student's grades in three different subjects and calculates the average of the grades. Then display the calculated average.

## Exercise 8: Interest Calculation
Create a function that calculates the final value of an investment based on initial capital, interest rate, and investment time (in months). The program must prompt the user for these values and display the final value.

Feel free to explore each exercise and use them to improve your Python skills. Happy coding!
